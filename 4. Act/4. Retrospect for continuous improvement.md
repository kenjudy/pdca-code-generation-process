# Act Phase: Session Analysis & Process Improvement

**Purpose:** Analyze collaboration effectiveness and identify process improvements
**When to use:** At the end of every coding session, regardless of scope
**Prerequisites:** Completed work session (successful or not)
**Expected output:** Critical moments analysis, actionable insights, working agreement updates
**Typical duration:** 5-10 minutes
**Next step:** Update working agreements and process templates based on learnings
**Critical:** Capture learnings while session details are fresh

## 5. Retrospection

```markdown
Let's retrospect on our coding session. Please address whichever of these areas seem most relevant:

**Session Overview:** What was our main goal and scope?

**Critical Moments Analysis:** 
- What were the 2-3 moments where our approach most impacted success/failure?
- What specific decisions or interventions were game-changers?

**Technical & Process Insights:** 
- What patterns in our collaboration most impacted effectiveness?
- What would have accelerated progress?
- What process elements worked well vs. need improvement?

**Collaboration Analysis:**
- Where did process discipline break down (if it did)?
- How effective was the "process police" intervention?
- What communication patterns helped vs. hindered progress?

**Top 3 Actionable Insights:**
1. **Start doing:** What prompting/guidance practice should you implement next time?
2. **Stop doing:** What setup/intervention approach should you eliminate?  
3. **Keep doing:** What guidance pattern was most valuable and should be protected?


**Next Session Setup Decisions:**
- **Process boundaries:** What rules should be non-negotiable vs. flexible?
- **Intervention triggers:** What specific behaviors should prompt immediate correction?  
- **Success metrics:** How will we know the process is working in the first 30 minutes?
- **Escape hatches:** When is it acceptable to deviate from the established process?
- **Discipline balance:** How can we maintain discipline while staying flexible?

Finally, **If you could only change ONE thing about our collaboration approach, what would it be and why?**
