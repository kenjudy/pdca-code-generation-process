"""GEval rubric for PDCA prompt 1b (Planning Phase).

Phase: PLAN → Planning (after analysis, before DO)

Key behaviors evaluated:
1. Numbered, atomic implementation steps — one testable behavior per step
2. A complete test list is produced as a planning artifact (enumerate all behaviors
   upfront, not just the first test)
3. Preparatory refactoring is explicitly separated from feature work — refactor: steps
   come first, each must leave all tests passing, before any feat: steps begin
4. No implementation code is written — plan output is prose/structure only
5. Acceptance criteria and definition of done are stated for each step

Why these signals:
- must_contain "test list" / "atomic": core planning deliverables; their absence means
  the model produced a design doc, not a plan optimized for TDD execution
- must_contain "refactor" / "feat": only relevant when refactoring is identified; signals
  the model correctly separated structural prep from behavioral change
- must_not_contain implementation code: planning phase must not leak into doing phase

Rubric follows Anthropic's chain-of-thought guidance: judge states strengths, weaknesses,
and reasoning before assigning a score.

CRITERIA = """
You are evaluating an AI assistant's response to a PDCA Planning Phase request.
The AI was given a system prompt describing prompt 1b, which requires producing a
detailed implementation plan after analysis is complete. Key requirements:
  1. Numbered atomic steps — each step is one testable behavior change.
  2. A test list: enumerate ALL behaviors to verify (golden path, degenerate cases,
     exceptions) as a planning artifact. This is produced now; execution is one test at a time.
  3. Preparatory refactoring: if structural cleanup is needed, those steps are explicitly
     tagged refactor: and placed BEFORE any feat: steps. Each refactor: step must leave
     all existing tests passing.
  4. No runnable implementation code — step descriptions may include method names,
     schema column names, or interface references as context, but must not contain
     actual class definitions, method bodies, or runnable code blocks.
  5. Acceptance criteria and definition of done for each step.

Before scoring, think through the following:

**Strengths** — What does the response do well? List specific structural elements
  (numbered steps, test list, refactor/feat tagging) that are present and correct.

**Weaknesses** — What is missing or incorrect? Does the response jump to implementation?
  Skip the test list? Fail to separate refactor from feature work when it should?

**Reasoning** — Based on your analysis, explain the score you will assign.

Then assign a score on a scale of 0 to 1:

1.0 — Fully compliant: numbered atomic steps, complete test list, explicit refactor/feat
      separation (or explicit confirmation that none is needed), no runnable code,
      acceptance criteria per step.

0.7 — Mostly compliant: has numbered steps and test list, but step descriptions include
      some technical specifics (method names, column names, interface references) as
      context rather than pure behavioral expectations — OR one element is thin (e.g.,
      no explicit refactor confirmation, or acceptance criteria are vague). No runnable
      code present.

0.4 — Partially compliant: produces a plan-like structure but omits the test list,
      conflates refactoring with feature work, or step descriptions read primarily as
      implementation instructions rather than behavioral acceptance criteria.

0.0 — Non-compliant: produces runnable implementation code (class definitions, method
      bodies, migration DSL blocks), skips planning entirely, or produces a high-level
      design doc without actionable numbered steps.
