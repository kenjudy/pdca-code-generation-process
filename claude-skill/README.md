# PDCA Framework Skills - Setup Guide

Two Claude skills for human-supervised AI collaboration using Plan-Do-Check-Act methodology.

---

## pdca-framework — AI-Assisted Code Generation

A disciplined framework for AI-assisted code generation with strict TDD:
- Maintains code quality through structured TDD practices
- Reduces technical debt by enforcing architecture pattern discovery
- Keeps humans actively engaged and accountable
- Provides structured prompts for analysis, planning, implementation, validation, and retrospection

**Based on research showing:** AI code generation without human oversight leads to 10x increase in duplicated code, 7.2% decrease in delivery stability, and 19% slower development.

---

## pdca-scaffold — Generalized PDCA Skill Generator

A tool for creating domain-specific PDCA skills for any complex repeatable human task:
- Socratic discovery across 5 layers to understand your task, human-AI role division, quality signals, and intervention points
- Generates a valid installable Claude skill tailored to your domain
- Built-in active learning loop: after each ACT phase, proposes specific diffs back to the skill's own reference files; the human approves and commits; the skill sharpens over cycles

Use `/pdca-scaffold` when you want to systematize a repeatable task outside of software development — content pipelines, research cycles, data analysis, legal review, client reporting, product design, or any other domain where human-AI collaboration benefits from structure.

## Building from Source

**Required before installation.** The `.skill` files are not included in the repository and must be built locally first.

**pdca-framework:**
```bash
cd claude-skill
./build-skill.sh
```

**pdca-scaffold:**
```bash
cd claude-skill
./build-scaffold.sh
```

**Windows (pdca-framework only):**
```powershell
cd claude-skill
.\build-skill.ps1
```

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for full details, including troubleshooting and CI/CD automation.

## Installation

**Important:** Claude.ai (web/desktop) and Claude Code (CLI) use different installation methods.

### For Claude.ai Web/Desktop App (Skill Upload)

This is the primary distribution path — upload `pdca-framework.skill` directly in Claude's UI.

1. **Download the skill file**
   - [**Download pdca-framework.skill**](https://github.com/kenjudy/pdca-framework/releases/latest/download/pdca-framework.skill) (latest release)
   - Or build from source: `cd claude-skill && bash build-skill.sh`

2. **Open Claude Settings**
   - Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) or open the Claude desktop app
   - Click **Customize** in the left sidebar (or your profile menu)
   - Select **Skills**

3. **Upload the skill**
   - Click **Add Skill**
   - Select `pdca-framework.skill`
   - Confirm the upload

4. **Enable the skill**
   - The skill appears in your skills list — toggle it on
   - Verify it shows as active

> **Org/team distribution:** Enterprise and Team plan admins can provision skills for their
> organization via the admin console. See Anthropic's
> [Skills for organizations](https://support.claude.com) documentation.

**Note:** To enable beads, see [Beads Integration](#beads-integration). The skill works without it.

### For Claude Code (Command Line)

Claude Code uses a **directory-based** skill format, not the `.skill` package file.

#### Quick Install (Recommended)

Use the installation script for automatic setup:

**macOS/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
# From the claude-skill directory
./install-skill.sh

# Optional: Specify scope as argument
./install-skill.sh personal   # Install to ~/.claude/skills/ (default)
./install-skill.sh project    # Install to current project's .claude/skills/
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# From the claude-skill directory
.\install-skill.ps1

# Optional: Specify scope as argument
.\install-skill.ps1 personal   # Install to ~/.claude/skills/ (default)
.\install-skill.ps1 project    # Install to current project's .claude/skills/
```

#### Manual Install - Personal Skills (Available Across All Projects)

```bash
# Create the parent directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills

# Install pdca-framework
unzip pdca-framework.skill -d ~/.claude/skills

#       └── beads-workflow.md      (optional — per-session beads reference)
```

#### Manual Install - Project Skill (Shared with Team via Git)

```bash
# From your project directory
mkdir -p .claude/skills

# Extract the skill package (zip contains pdca-framework/ at root)
unzip /path/to/pdca-framework.skill -d .claude/skills

# Commit to share with team
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add PDCA framework skill"
```

#### Verify Installation

```bash
# For personal skills
ls ~/.claude/skills/pdca-framework/

# For project skills
ls .claude/skills/pdca-framework/

# Should show: SKILL.md and references/
```

**Note:** Skills are automatically discovered by Claude Code. No restart needed.

## Quick Start

### Starting a New Coding Session

Simply mention your coding task and the skill will auto-trigger:

```
I need to add a new payment validation feature to our checkout flow. 
Let's use the PDCA framework.
```

Or explicitly reference the skill:

```
@pdca-framework I need to fix a bug in the user authentication system.
```

### Following the PDCA Cycle

The skill will guide you through four phases:

#### 1. **PLAN** (7-15 min)
Claude will prompt you through:
- **Analysis**: Understanding the problem and discovering existing patterns
- **Planning**: Creating atomic, testable implementation steps

#### 2. **DO** (30 min - 2.5 hrs)
Claude will provide:
- **TDD checklists**: Red-green-refactor discipline
- **Integration guidance**: Real components over mocks
- **Process checkpoints**: When to pause and validate

#### 3. **CHECK** (2-5 min)
Claude will verify:
- **Completeness**: All objectives met
- **Quality**: Tests passing, no regressions
- **Process compliance**: TDD maintained throughout

#### 4. **ACT** (5-10 min)
Claude will facilitate:
- **Retrospective**: What worked, what didn't
- **Improvements**: 1-3 changes for next cycle
- **Learning capture**: Update working agreements

---

## Using Specific Phases

### Get Analysis Prompt
```
@pdca-framework Show me the analysis phase prompt
```

### Get Planning Prompt
```
@pdca-framework I need the detailed planning template
```

### Get TDD Implementation Checklist
```
@pdca-framework Show me the DO phase checklist
```

### Run a Retrospective
```
@pdca-framework Let's retrospect on this session
```

---

## Working Agreements

The skill includes working agreements that define your collaboration contract with the AI. Key principles:

- **USE TDD FOR CHANGES** - Intervene when agent breaks discipline
- **One change at a time** - No fixing multiple things simultaneously
- **Respect existing architecture** - Work within established patterns
- **Process discipline trumps immediate progress** - Stop and correct violations

These are stored in the skill and referenced automatically, but you can also review them:

```
@pdca-framework Show me the working agreements
```

---

## Customizing for Your Team

### Step 1: Export the Skill Contents
Ask Claude to show you the current prompt templates:
```
@pdca-framework Show me the [PLAN/DO/CHECK/ACT] phase prompts
```

### Step 2: Identify Changes
Based on your retrospectives, determine what needs updating:
- Language-specific testing patterns (pytest, jest, xUnit, etc.)
- Your team's architectural conventions
- Project-specific quality gates
- Intervention triggers that work for your team

### Step 3: Document Your Changes
Keep a working document of your customizations:
```markdown
## Our Team's PDCA Customizations

### Analysis Phase
- Added: Terraform state validation check
- Changed: "codebase_search" → our internal tool name

### TDD Implementation
- Added: Our cypress integration test pattern
- Removed: References to unit test patterns we don't use
```

### Step 4: Request Skill Updates
When you have 3-5 meaningful changes:
```
@pdca-framework Based on our retrospectives, I want to update the 
analysis phase to include [specific change]. Can you help me create 
an updated version of this skill?
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Triggering
**Symptoms:** Claude doesn't use the framework when discussing code

**Solutions:**
1. Explicitly reference it: `@pdca-framework`
2. Use trigger words: "code generation", "TDD", "PDCA cycle"
3. Check skill is enabled in settings

### Context Drift During DO Phase
**Symptoms:** Agent makes sprawling changes, ignores TDD, breaks rules

**Solution:** This is expected behavior when context window fills. Follow the skill's recovery process:
1. Stop the thread immediately
2. Tell Claude what you observe
3. Say: `@pdca-framework I'm seeing context drift. Let's refocus on step [X] using the DO phase checklist`

### Too Much Boilerplate
**Symptoms:** Prompts feel repetitive or verbose

**Solution:** The skill is designed for 1-3 hour coding sessions. For very small changes:
```
@pdca-framework Quick mode - I just need to [simple change]. 
Skip to DO phase with minimal planning.
```

### Agent Suggests Non-TDD Approach
**Symptoms:** Claude proposes skipping tests or making large changes

**Solution:** Invoke your working agreements:
```
Stop. Our working agreement is to use TDD. Show me the failing test first.
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Right-Size Your Sessions
- **Ideal:** 1-3 hours of focused work
- **Too small:** < 30 minutes (overhead > value)
- **Too large:** > 3 hours (context drift likely)

### 2. Run Daily Retrospectives
After each session:
```
@pdca-framework Let's retrospect on today's work
```
Make 1-3 small improvements, not wholesale changes.

### 3. Keep Working Agreements Visible
Print or display your working agreements during coding sessions. They're your intervention triggers.

### 4. Intervene Early and Often
Don't wait for big problems:
- "You're on step 3 but this looks like step 5 work"
- "Did you write the failing test first?"
- "Are we respecting the existing FileProvider pattern?"

### 5. Use Real Components in Tests
Question any mocking:
```
Why are we mocking the file system? 
Can we use a temporary directory instead?
```

---

## When NOT to Use This Skill

The PDCA framework is designed for **production code generation**. Don't use it for:

- **Exploratory coding** - Quick experiments, prototypes
- **Documentation writing** - README files, API docs
- **Configuration changes** - YAML, JSON, environment files
- **Trivial changes** - Typo fixes, import reordering
- **Learning exercises** - Tutorials, katas, practice problems

For these tasks, regular Claude conversation is more appropriate.

## Learning More

### Understanding the Research
The skill is based on documented research showing AI code generation quality issues:
- GitClear 2024: 10x increase in duplicated code
- Google DORA 2024: 7.2% stability decrease per 25% AI adoption
- METR 2025: 19% slower development with AI tools

Presentation prepared for [XP 2026](https://kenjudy.us/presentations/human-centric-ai-code-generation/)

### Philosophy
This framework embodies agile principles:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools (human oversight)
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation (TDD focus)
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation (value-based objectives)
- **Responding to change** over following a plan (retrospection)

   └─ Analysis: Discover patterns, validate external systems
   └─ Planning: Create atomic steps, define testing strategy

2. DO (30 min - 2.5 hrs)
   └─ Red: Write failing test
   └─ Green: Minimal code to pass
   └─ Refactor: Clean up
   └─ Repeat for each step

3. CHECK (2-5 min)
   └─ All tests passing?
   └─ Process discipline maintained?
   └─ Ready to close?

4. ACT (5-10 min)

## Development Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (`brew install uv` or `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)

### For running unit tests (no API key needed)

```bash
cd claude-skill
uv sync --extra test
bash run-tests.sh
```

### For running eval tests (requires Anthropic API key, ~$2-5/full run)

LLM-as-judge evaluations check whether each PDCA phase prompt produces compliant responses
across a range of scenarios. Claude Haiku acts as the judge, scoring outputs against a
chain-of-thought rubric (strengths → weaknesses → reasoning → score).

```bash
cd claude-skill
uv sync --extra eval
cp .env.example .env          # add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
bash run-evals.sh             # run all prompt evals
```

To run a single prompt's evals:

```bash
bash run-evals.sh tests/test_evals.py::TestPrompt1aEvals
```

Eval tests are tagged `@pytest.mark.eval` and are **excluded from the default test suite**.
They are not run in CI — invoke manually when iterating on phase prompt quality.

> **Note:** Unit tests (`run-tests.sh`) run in CI on every push. Eval tests cost API tokens
> and are intentionally on-demand only.

---

## Beads Integration

**Optional** — the skill works without beads. Set it up when you want persistent task tracking across multi-day sessions. Beads is created by [Steve Yegge](https://github.com/steveyegge).

All beads commands in the prompts are optional. The skill includes `references/beads-setup.md` (first-time install guide) and `references/beads-workflow.md` (per-session reference) that Claude loads only when needed.

### Understanding Global Skill vs. Per-Project Beads

**Important distinction:**

| Component | Location | Scope | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|-------|---------|
| **Skill Installation** | `~/.claude/skills/pdca-framework-beads/` | Global | PDCA prompts available in all projects |
| **Beads Database** | `.beads/` in each project root | Per-Project | Task tracking for THAT project only |

**You install the skill once globally, but initialize beads separately in each project.**

**Why per-project beads?**
- PDCA cycles are project-specific (features, bugs, experiments for that codebase)
- Retrospectives make sense in project context ("How did auth work in THIS app?")
- Searching is more relevant: `bd list --closed` shows THIS project's history
- Team collaboration: share issue history via git (JSONL files) or Dolt remote (`bd dolt push`)
- Clean separation: No mixing dashboard tasks with unrelated projects

**Why NOT one global beads database?**
- Searching "authentication retrospectives" would return ALL projects (too noisy)
- Epic/task organization becomes confusing across codebases
- Can't scope queries to relevant work
- Can't share project-specific retrospectives via git

**The architecture:**
1. Install skill globally (once) → prompts available everywhere
2. Initialize beads per-project → task tracking scoped to that project
3. When working in a project, the global skill prompts guide you to use that project's local `.beads/` database

### Prerequisites

**System Requirements:**
```bash
# Required
brew install go icu4c dolt

# Verify versions
go version    # Should be 1.23+
dolt version  # Should be 1.80+
```

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Install Beads CLI

```bash
# Set ICU paths for compilation
ICU_PATH=$(brew --prefix icu4c@78)
export CGO_CFLAGS="-I${ICU_PATH}/include"
export CGO_CXXFLAGS="-I${ICU_PATH}/include"
export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L${ICU_PATH}/lib"

# Install beads with CGO support
CGO_ENABLED=1 go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest

# Add to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"

# Verify installation
bd --version
```

**⚠️ Always use this CGO build method to upgrade beads.** The `curl | bash` install script that `bd doctor` recommends installs a prebuilt binary *without* CGO support. That binary cannot open the Dolt database and will break beads entirely. To upgrade: re-run the `CGO_ENABLED=1 go install` command above.

#### 2. Install Beads MCP Server (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Install beads MCP server
pip3 install beads-mcp

# Configure in Claude Desktop/Code
# Add to ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "beads": {
      "command": "beads-mcp"
    }
  }
}

# Restart Claude Desktop/Code after configuration
```

#### 3. Initialize Beads Per-Project (Repeat for Each Project)

**Important:** Run this in EACH project where you want beads tracking, not just once globally.

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialize beads (creates .beads/ in THIS project)
bd init

# Created: .beads/ directory (local to this project)
```

**Example:** If you work on 3 projects:
```bash
cd ~/Projects/dashboard && bd init      # Creates ~/Projects/dashboard/.beads/
cd ~/Projects/api && bd init            # Creates ~/Projects/api/.beads/
cd ~/Projects/frontend && bd init       # Creates ~/Projects/frontend/.beads/
```

Each project gets its own independent beads database for tracking its PDCA cycles.

#### 4. Choose a .beads/ sharing strategy

`bd init` may add `.beads/` to `.gitignore`. Decide how you want to share beads data with collaborators:

**Option A: Git-native (commit JSONL bridge files)**

Keep `.beads/` excluded but allow the JSONL files that serve as the git-friendly bridge. Add to `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
.beads/
!.beads/.gitignore
!.beads/config.yaml
!.beads/metadata.json
!.beads/issues.jsonl
!.beads/interactions.jsonl
!.beads/hooks/
```

The binary `embeddeddolt/` data is Dolt's own versioning territory -- do not commit it to git.

**Option B: Dolt-native (bd dolt push)**

Leave `.beads/` excluded from git and share via Dolt's remote:

```bash
bd dolt push   # push to Dolt remote
bd dolt pull   # pull on another machine
```

See `references/beads-setup.md` for the full post-init checklist including CLAUDE.md alignment.

### Using Beads with PDCA

Each PDCA phase includes optional beads sections in the prompts. Example workflow:

**PLAN Phase:**
```bash
# Create epic for this PDCA cycle
bd create "Feature: Add user authentication" --type epic
# Returns: myproject-a1b2
```

**DO Phase:**
```bash
# Track each TDD step
bd create "Step 1: Write failing test for JWT middleware" --parent myproject-a1b2
bd update myproject-a1b2.1 --claim --status in_progress

# After tests pass
bd close myproject-a1b2.1 --message "✓ Tests pass, committed abc123"
```

**CHECK Phase:**
```bash
# Verify all tasks complete
bd list --parent myproject-a1b2 --status open,in_progress
```

**ACT Phase:**
```bash
# Store retrospective
bd update myproject-a1b2 --append-notes "Retrospective: TDD kept scope focused..."
bd close myproject-a1b2
```

### Benefits of Beads Integration

- **Cross-session continuity**: Resume work days/weeks later with `bd show <epic-id>`
- **Dependency tracking**: `bd dep add <task> <blocker> blocks`
- **Searchable retrospectives**: `bd list --closed --type epic | grep auth`
- **Git-backed audit trail**: Issues committed as `.beads/issues.jsonl` (travels with your repo)

### Troubleshooting Beads

**"bd: command not found"**
- Add `$HOME/go/bin` to your PATH
- Verify installation: `ls ~/go/bin/bd`

**"dolt: this binary was built without CGO support"**
- Reinstall beads with CGO flags (see Installation Step 1)
- Ensure ICU headers are installed: `brew install icu4c`

**"invalid database name: beads_Your Project" (spaces in project path)**
- Beads v0.59+ rejects database names with spaces (derived from the project directory name)
- Rename the Dolt database directory: `mv .beads/dolt/"beads_Your Project" .beads/dolt/beads_Your_Project`
- Update `.beads/metadata.json`: change `"dolt_database"` to match the new name (underscores)
- Restart the Dolt server: `bd dolt stop && bd dolt start`
- Run `bd doctor --fix` to clean up any remaining issues

**MCP server not showing**
- Verify `claude_desktop_config.json` has `mcpServers.beads`
- Restart Claude Desktop/Code completely
- Check for MCP errors in Claude logs

For detailed beads documentation, see:
- `references/beads-setup.md` — first-time installation and MCP configuration
- `references/beads-workflow.md` — per-phase commands for active sessions
