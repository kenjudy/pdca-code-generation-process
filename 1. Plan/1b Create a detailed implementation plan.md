# Planning Phase: Detailed Implementation Strategy

**Purpose:** Create trackable, atomic implementation steps optimized for AI execution
**When to use:** After completing analysis phase(s)
**Prerequisites:** Clear problem understanding and chosen approach from analysis
**Expected output:** Numbered implementation steps, testing strategy, process checkpoints
**Typical duration:** 2-5 minutes
**Next step:** Begin TDD implementation (2)
**Note:** Plan output is verbose and typically not added to ticket tracking

If available run this prompt in "Planning" mode.

**Planning Phase** Based on our analysis, provide a coherent plan incorporating our refinements that is optimized for your use as context for the implementation:

**Execution Context:** This plan will be implemented in steps following TDD discipline with human supervision. Each step tagged for optimal model selection within the same thread context.

**Integration Strategy:**

- Map end-to-end data flow and all touch points
- Identify required changes to existing methods/interfaces
- Plan backward compatibility approach
- Consider file organization and naming consistency

**Testing Strategy:** Test Drive atomic changes to production code using red/green strategy

- Break the work into atomic, incremental changes
- For each task or batch: write failing test(s) with clear behavioral expectations that drive code changes needed
- Compilation â‰  Red phase - Write compiling stubs first, then test actual behavior expectations, not symbol existence
- Implement minimal code to pass tests. Max 3 iterations to green
- Summarize outcome and refactoring needs providing a commit message. Wait for approval before proceeding

**Opportunities for Batched TDD:**

- Group related functionality into logical batches for pattern reuse
- Write failing tests for batch components together
- Implement batch while maintaining red/green discipline

**Multi-System Work:**

- [ ] Logical architecture identical across systems
- [ ] System-specific constraints checked (reserved keywords, etc.)

**Create actionable plan with:**

- Numbered implementation steps (small, testable increments)
- ONE file/component per step when possible
- Acceptance criteria for each step
- Definition of done (tests pass + process followed)
- Risk areas to monitor
- Rollback approach if needed

**Process Checkpoints:**

- Verify adherence to chosen testing strategy
- Each step: Confirm appropriate test coverage exists
- Complexity check: If tests become complex, simplify the step
- Model match verification: Is the tagged model appropriate for actual complexity encountered?

```

_Plan is verbose and I don't add it to any tracking_
