# Troubleshooting Phase: TDD-Guided Problem Diagnosis

**Purpose:** Apply TDD discipline to debugging and problem diagnosis
**When to use:** When investigating production issues, test failures, or unexpected behavior
**Prerequisites:** Clear problem description or failing scenario
**Expected output:** Root cause identification with test coverage or diagnostic logging
**Typical duration:** 30 minutes to 2+ hours depending on complexity
**Next step:** Return to normal TDD flow (2) for fixes, or completeness check (3)
**Critical:** Maintain TDD discipline even in diagnostic mode

## **TDD + Production Debugging - Step [X]**
We're implementing: [specific diagnostic/fix step]

## **üö® TDD CHECK (Troubleshooting Mode) üö®**
- [ ] **RED**: Failing test OR diagnostic logging added first
- [ ] **GREEN**: Test passes OR hypothesis confirmed via logs  
- [ ] **Simple**: One focused change at a time

## **RED Phase Options:**
1. Write failing test (traditional)
2. Add targeted logging (diagnostic)
3. Enhanced production logging (analysis)

## **Production-Safe Logging:**
- INFO level+, human-readable, no sensitive data
- Log key decision points & data state transitions
- Safe to leave in production

## **Ready for commit?** 
- [ ] Test failing OR logging added ‚úÖ
- [ ] Passes OR hypothesis confirmed ‚úÖ  
- [ ] Code clean ‚úÖ
- [ ] Root cause identified (for fixes) ‚úÖ

**Next:** What's the next smallest testable/diagnosable piece?
**‚ö†Ô∏è Alert:** User intervenes if TDD discipline breaks OR debugging becomes unfocused!
