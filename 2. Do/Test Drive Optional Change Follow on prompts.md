**Purpose:** Identify opportunities for code reuse and maintainability improvements
**When to use:** After completing implementation steps, before final completeness check
**Prerequisites:** Working implementation that meets requirements
**Expected output:** Refactoring recommendations without code changes
**Typical duration:** 10-20 minutes
**Next step:** Apply recommendations through TDD process (2) or proceed to completeness check (3)
