# Ramifications Analysis: Deep Dive on Selected Approach

**Purpose:** Detailed analysis of chosen approach including architectural implications and integration points
**When to use:** When initial analysis reveals complex architectural considerations or multiple viable approaches
**Prerequisites:** Completed initial analysis (1a) with preferred approach identified
**Expected output:** Detailed approach validation, integration strategy, architectural alignment check
**Typical duration:** 2-5 minutes
**Next step:** Proceed to detailed planning (1b)

**Analyze the Ramifications of the Selected Approach**

Please analyze this work request and explore the approach:

**Request:** [describe the feature/change/bug fix]

**Current Context:** [attach or reference relevant code, files, or system state]

**Pattern Discovery (do this first):**
- Examine existing similar implementations in the codebase
- Identify architectural patterns and design decisions Â 
- Document key conventions (naming, ID generation, file organization)
- Note integration points and data flow patterns

**Problem Analysis:**
- Understand the problem and its scope
- Explore different approaches or solutions
- Identify potential challenges, dependencies, or unknowns
- Consider architectural implications or patterns
- Assess complexity and effort (rough estimate)
- Note any assumptions or clarifications needed

**Architecture Alignment Check:**
- [ ] For complex systems: verify intended design matches current implementation
- [ ] Identify architectural inconsistencies before building on them

**Output:** Provide a clear understanding of the problem and recommended approach. Focus on the "what" and "why" - we'll create the actionable "how" in the planning phase.
