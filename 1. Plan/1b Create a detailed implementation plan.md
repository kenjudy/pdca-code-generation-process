# Planning Phase: Detailed Implementation Strategy

**Purpose:** Create trackable, atomic implementation steps optimized for AI execution
**When to use:** After completing analysis phase(s)
**Prerequisites:** Clear problem understanding and chosen approach from analysis
**Expected output:** Numbered implementation steps, testing strategy, process checkpoints
**Typical duration:** 2-5 minutes
**Next step:** Begin TDD implementation (2)
**Note:** Plan output is verbose and typically not added to ticket tracking

If available run this prompt in "Planning" mode.

**Planning Phase** Based on our analysis, provide a coherent plan incorporating our refinements that is optimized for your use as context for the implementation:

**Execution Context:** This plan will be implemented in steps following TDD discipline with human supervision. Each step tagged for optimal model selection within the same thread context.

**Integration Strategy:**

- Map end-to-end data flow and all touch points
- Identify required changes to existing methods/interfaces
- Plan backward compatibility approach
- Consider file organization and naming consistency

**Testing Strategy:** Implementation follows TDD discipline — one failing test at a time. See DO phase for execution rules.

- Break the work into atomic, testable increments — one behavior per step
- For each step, identify the behavioral expectation to be verified (not implementation details)
- Build a test list: enumerate all behaviors to verify (golden path, degenerate cases, exceptions) as a planning artifact — execution is always one test at a time

**Preparatory Refactoring (if needed):**

Before behavioral steps begin, identify any structural cleanup required to make the feature change easy:
- [ ] Does any existing code need to be extracted, renamed, or reorganized to cleanly accommodate this change?
- [ ] If yes: list these as explicit first steps in the plan, tagged `refactor:` commits, before any `feat:` steps
- [ ] Preparatory refactoring steps must leave all existing tests passing — no behavioral change
- [ ] If none needed: explicitly confirm structure is ready as-is

**Multi-System Work:**

- [ ] Logical architecture identical across systems
- [ ] System-specific constraints checked (reserved keywords, etc.)

**Create actionable plan with:**

- Numbered implementation steps (small, testable increments)
- ONE file/component per step when possible
- Acceptance criteria for each step
- Definition of done (tests pass + process followed)
- Risk areas to monitor
- Rollback approach if needed

**Process Checkpoints:**

- Complexity check: If a step feels too large to test atomically, split it
- Model match verification: Is the tagged model appropriate for actual complexity encountered?

```
