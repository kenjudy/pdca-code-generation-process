# Human-AI PDCA Collaboration Framework

A disciplined framework for AI-assisted code generation using Plan-Do-Check-Act methodology with strict TDD discipline.

## Three Ways to Use This Framework

### Option 1: Claude Skill - Standard (Recommended for Most Users)
**Install once, auto-triggers when coding**

- **Best for:** Consistent PDCA workflow across all coding sessions
- **Setup:** One-click installation in Claude.ai or Claude Code
- **Experience:** Automatic prompt loading, progressive disclosure
- **Token efficiency:** Loads only what's needed in background
- **Maintenance:** Update once, improves everywhere

### Option 2: Claude Skill - with Beads (For Long-Running Work)
**Standard skill + persistent task tracking across sessions**

- **Best for:** Complex features spanning multiple days/weeks
- **Additional features:** Git-backed memory, cross-session continuity, searchable retrospectives
- **Requirements:** Install beads CLI and MCP server (Go 1.23+, ICU headers)
- **Works like:** Standard skill with optional beads commands in each phase
- **Backward compatible:** All beads commands are optional, skip them if beads not installed

🎯 **[Get started with Beads Skill →](claude-skill/README.md#beads-integration)**

### Option 3: Manual Prompts (Best for Customization)
**Copy/paste prompts as needed for each session**

- **Best for:** Customizing prompts for specific contexts
- **Setup:** Create symlinks or copy files to `.claude/` directory
- **Experience:** 100% visible in conversation, full control
- **Flexibility:** Easy to customize per-session
- **Portability:** Works with any AI tool, not just Claude

## PDCA Framework Overview

The PDCA workflow consists of four phases:
1. **Plan** - Analysis and detailed planning
2. **Do** - Test-driven implementation
3. **Check** - Completeness verification
4. **Act** - Retrospection and continuous improvement

# Manual Prompt Setup (Claude Code)

The rest of this document describes how to set up the manual prompt workflow in Claude Code using symlinked files.

For the Claude Skill setup, see **[claude-skill/README.md](claude-skill/README.md)** instead.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 with Developer Mode enabled (for symlinks without admin rights)
- Claude Code CLI installed
- Git configured with `core.symlinks = true`

## Project Structure

After setup, your project should have:

```
your-project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── instructions.md          # Main workflow instructions
│   ├── prompts/                 # Symlinked phase templates
│   │   ├── 1a Analyze to determine approach for achieving the goal.md
│   │   ├── 1b Create a detailed implementation plan.md
│   │   ├── 2. Test Drive the Change.md
│   │   ├── 3. Completeness Check.md
│   │   └── 4. Retrospect for continuous improvement.md
│   └── validation.md            # Pre-commit checklist
├── .claudeignore                # Files for Claude to ignore
└── LinkPrompts.ps1              # Script to create symlinks (optional)
```

## Setup Steps

### 1. Enable Developer Mode (Windows)

To create symlinks without admin rights:
1. Open Settings → Update & Security → For Developers
2. Turn on **Developer Mode**
3. Restart PowerShell/Terminal

### 2. Configure Git for Symlinks

```bash
git config core.symlinks true
```

### 3. Create Directory Structure

From your project root:

```powershell
# Create .claude directory structure
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path ".claude\prompts" -Force
```

### 4. Create Symlinks to Prompt Templates

**Option A: Manual Creation**

```powershell
# From your project root
# Replace $TEMPLATES_PATH with your actual path to the PDCA templates
$TEMPLATES_PATH = "C:\path\to\pdca-templates"

New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path ".claude\prompts\1a Analyze to determine approach for achieving the goal.md" -Target "$TEMPLATES_PATH\1. Plan\1a Analyze to determine approach for achieving the goal.md"
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path ".claude\prompts\1b Create a detailed implementation plan.md" -Target "$TEMPLATES_PATH\1. Plan\1b Create a detailed implementation plan.md"
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path ".claude\prompts\2. Test Drive the Change.md" -Target "$TEMPLATES_PATH\2. Do\2. Test Drive the Change.md"
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path ".claude\prompts\3. Completeness Check.md" -Target "$TEMPLATES_PATH\3. Check\3. Completeness Check.md"
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path ".claude\prompts\4. Retrospect for continuous improvement.md" -Target "$TEMPLATES_PATH\4. Act\4. Retrospect for continuous improvement.md"
```

**Option B: Using Script**

Create `LinkPrompts.ps1` in your project root (or a shared location) and run it from each project directory.

### 5. Create `.claudeignore`

Create `.claudeignore` in your project root with appropriate patterns for your C# project (see section below).

### 6. Create `.claude/instructions.md`

Create the main instructions file that Claude Code will read automatically (see section below).

### 7. Create `.claude/validation.md` (Optional)

Create a validation checklist for pre-commit checks (see section below).

# Project Development Workflow

This project follows a strict PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) development process with TDD discipline.

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1a: Analysis (MANDATORY FIRST)
- Execute codebase_search to discover existing patterns
- Validate external system formats before making assumptions
- Document architectural constraints
- Assess delegation complexity

### Phase 1b: Planning
- Create numbered, atomic implementation steps
- Define testing strategy (TDD with red-green-refactor)
- Identify integration touch points
- Plan for incremental delivery

### Phase 2: Test-Driven Implementation
**CRITICAL RULES:**
- ❌ DON'T test interfaces - test concrete implementations
- ❌ DON'T use compilation errors as RED phase
- ✅ DO write failing behavioral tests FIRST
- ✅ DO use real components over mocks
- Max 3 iterations per red-green cycle

### Phase 3: Completeness Check
- Verify all objectives met
- Audit process discipline
- Confirm no TODOs remain

### Phase 4: Retrospection
- Analyze critical moments
- Extract actionable insights
- Update working agreements

## Testing Conventions
- NUnit with Assert.That syntax
- Leverage TestUtils.cs and fixtures directory
- Add tests to existing fixtures when coherent
- Avoid proliferating new test files

## Process Checkpoints
Before proceeding with implementation:
- [ ] Have I searched for similar implementations?
- [ ] Have I validated external system formats?
- [ ] Have I written a FAILING test first?
- [ ] Am I implementing ONLY enough to pass the test?

## Detailed Phase Instructions
See `.claude/prompts/` directory for detailed instructions for each phase.

## Pre-Commit Validation Checklist

Before each commit, verify:

- [ ] Test was written and failed FIRST (true RED phase)
- [ ] Implementation makes test pass with minimal code
- [ ] No compilation-only reds (compilation errors don't count as RED)
- [ ] Using real components where possible (avoid unnecessary mocks)
- [ ] Following existing codebase patterns discovered in analysis
- [ ] TDD discipline maintained throughout (max 3 red-green iterations)
- [ ] Code is clean and refactored
- [ ] No TODOs or placeholder implementations remain
```

## Usage Workflow

### Starting a New Feature

Always work through phases sequentially:

#### Phase 1a: Analysis

```bash
claude-code "Following .claude/prompts/1a: Analyze implementing [feature description]. 
Search codebase for similar patterns before proposing approach. 
STOP after analysis and wait for approval."
```

**Review the analysis before proceeding.**

#### Phase 1b: Planning

```bash
claude-code "Based on approved analysis, create detailed implementation plan 
following .claude/prompts/1b. Break into atomic TDD steps."
```

**Review the plan and approve specific steps.**

#### Phase 2: Implementation (Step by Step)

```bash
# For each planned step:
claude-code "Test-drive step [N]: [specific requirement]. 
Follow .claude/prompts/2 TDD discipline strictly. 
Write failing test FIRST, then minimal implementation."
```

**Key points:**
- One step at a time
- Always RED (failing test) before GREEN (implementation)
- Review after each step before proceeding
- Maximum 3 red-green iterations per step

#### Phase 3: Completeness Check

```bash
claude-code "Run completeness check per .claude/prompts/3. 
Verify all planned steps complete and process followed."
```

#### Phase 4: Retrospection

```bash
claude-code "Retrospect on this implementation session following .claude/prompts/4. 
Identify what worked well and what to improve."
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Explicit Phase References
Always mention `.claude/prompts/[phase].md` in your commands so Claude knows where to look.

### 2. One Phase at a Time
Don't ask Claude to "implement feature X end-to-end". Break it into discrete phases.

### 3. Stop and Review
Use explicit STOP instructions after analysis and planning phases for human review.

### 4. Context Preservation
Use the same Claude Code conversation/task thread to maintain context across phases.

### 5. TDD Discipline Enforcement
If Claude strays from TDD discipline:
- Stop the task immediately
- Point out the specific violation
- Repost the relevant phase instructions
- Resume with corrected approach

### 6. Small, Testable Increments
Each implementation step should be:
- Completable in one TDD cycle
- Testable in isolation
- Additive (doesn't break existing tests)

## Troubleshooting

### Symlinks Not Working
- Verify Developer Mode is enabled
- Check that `git config core.symlinks` is true
- Ensure you're running PowerShell from project root
- Try creating one symlink manually to test permissions

### Claude Not Following Process
- Explicitly reference `.claude/prompts/[phase].md` in commands
- Break requests into smaller, phase-specific chunks
- Add "STOP and wait for approval" to prevent Claude from jumping ahead
- Review `.claude/instructions.md` - ensure it's clear and concise

### Tests Not Following TDD
- Verify you're requesting "failing test FIRST"
- Check that RED phase is behavioral failure, not compilation error
- Limit to 3 red-green iterations per step
- Reference `.claude/prompts/2` explicitly in implementation requests

### Context Loss Over Long Sessions
- Start new Claude Code task after 8-10 implementation steps
- Reference previous work: "Based on previous implementation of [X]..."
- Keep `.claude/instructions.md` concise so it's always in context

## Advanced: Multi-Project Setup

To use these prompts across multiple projects:

1. Keep your master prompts in a central location (e.g., iCloud/Obsidian)
2. Create a shared `LinkPrompts.ps1` script that takes project path as parameter
3. Run the script once per project to set up symlinks
4. All projects stay in sync with your master PDCA templates

```powershell
# Shared script usage (adjust path to your script location)
& "C:\path\to\your\LinkPrompts.ps1" -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\project"
```
